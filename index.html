        <h1>Muskan Pugalia Jain</h1>
        <p> <em>Associate System Engineer - <strong><a href="https://www.tcs.com/">TCS</a></strong> </em> </p>

        <p>I am an Associate System Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services. I like reading(mostly fictional genre), singing, cooking.
          I aspire to be not at beginner's level in atleast one technical domain(if it is more than one, not going to complain about it), but as a rookie(rookie because the experience that I am getting at TCS is not much of an experience), I'm still
          exploring the fields so as to get to know which field fascinates me the most. Till now, I have explored fields like Linux(RHCSA), Ansible(RHCoE in Ansible
          Automation) which is an DevOps automation tool, Python CGI(this one becomes a power to reckon with when integrated with HTML and Linux itself), unity(but could not hold my interest). I also want to record my technical development too, for
          which I
          keep a hand-written journal(I know, an s/w engg. and still old-school methods, I like it ok! Do not judge).
          A to-do list(again hand-written). These are very effective as the keep a record of pretty much my everything, whether it be my professional standing, technical soundness, emotional stability, mental health and physical habits. I am a self
          motivater which plays a big role in my self-learning journey, also it makes a little more disciplined on my own, which is a very important characteristics if you want to grow. Sometimes, I feel tired not physically but mentally and
          emotionally.
          But being a self-motivater, that mental state does not last for long. I am very interested in creative and innovative alternatives too. For my hobbies in these fields, I like painting, also learning to play guitar.
